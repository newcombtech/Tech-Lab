#Technology Lab 

**Lab's Outcomes**

Newcomb Institute’s Technology Lab educates undergraduates about gender equity through student programming that:

- works towards reducing the gender gap in technology by building supportive feminist-minded technology communities for undergraduates at Tulane University,
- makes technology work and digital research more accessible and relevant for technical and non-technical majors through interdisciplinary collaboration with peers, faculty, and community partners.
- creates a process for viewing digital research and technical work as connected to social and humanities-based research questions and issues and provides a framework for working through those questions using feminist pedagogies and epistemologies.

**Lab's Objectives**

Interns and Grantees will:

- Work concurrently on a range of digital scholarship / research projects of Tulane faculty, Newcomb Institute, and community partners while building a portfolio that represents an array of technical, research, and essential skills such as digital media, data, computing, mapping, and digital archiving.
- Collaborate and network as part of interdisciplinary feminist-minded technology community on campus with peers and faculty.
- Examine through scholarly curriculum and praxis how feminist technology leadership practices and gender and technology studies enhances job-market preparation, professional development, product design, technical collaboration, and networking to bring about gender equity in technology,
- Become a maker / producer of open-sourced technical and scholarly knowledge/products such as project deliverables, technology conference / product reviews, a skill-based github, project manuals, and scholarship about gender and other intersecting identities as it pertains to the field of technology studies.
