> the lab. All meetings should be conducted via zoom.
>
> Remuneration:
>
> This is a paid internship. You are expected to work 5 hours a week AND
> meet with the SCRUM team once a week, for a total of 6 hours. You will
> be paid hourly/\$10.00. You must receive permission to work more than
> 6 hours a week.
>
> You may only clock in and out using a lab computer AND sign in/out in
> the lab on the clipboard.
>
> If you miss a time punch, email Hillary Margherio,
> [[hscholl@tulane.edu]{.underline}](mailto:hscholl@tulane.edu) and cc

>
> Communication:
>
> You are expected to communicate when you need help, are confused, or

> weekly. When sending emails you should always use your Tulane email
> account. Agile is a about collaboration and communication.
>
> The Scrum Process:

1.  Scrum Advisor (Jacque) meets with faculty to build syllabus.

2.  Scum Advisor provides syllabus to Product Developer and Devs.

3.  Product Developer (Lindsay) takes syllabus and builds a product log
    > of features. The Product Developer meets with Scrum Advisor, the
    > faculty (first week) to break down the

> objectives in the syllabus into manageable goals and assigns those
> goals a Sprint based on priority.

4.  Product Developer brings the Product backlog to the weekly stand-up
    > meeting. The Development team takes Sprint goals assigned for that
    > Sprint and breaks the goals down further into the Sprint Backlog.
    > The Sprint Backlog indicates the task, status (complete, pending,
    > parking lot), who is assigned that task, sprint deadline.
    > Development team delegates the tasks amongst themselves.

    a.  Dev team members should be assigned to work on large tasks in
        > pairs and should not always work on the same project.

    b.  If items go into the parking lot, Dev Team members need to
        > actively attempt to find resolution before the end of the
        > sprint. Write detailed comments about why you are stuck in the
        > comments. Dev Team members and the product developer should
        > check the parking lot on each shift.

5.  During the sprint week, the students work on the tasks in the lab
    > (five hours). As they complete the tasks, they move the items in
    > the appropriate columns. The product developer meets with faculty
    > about the progress made the previous sprint week and meets with
    > Jacque to look ahead. They adjust the future Product backlog
    > priority list for the next sprint.

6.  During the next stand-up meeting, the development team reports on
    > their progress and prepares for the next sprint and the Product
    > Developer brings feedback from faculty and brings updated product
    > log (Repeat step 4). Scrum Facilitator manages the process and
    > work-flows, provides support and negotiates ties.

> Faculty clients and the Product Developer meets one-on-one. Dev team
> members can attend these meetings with the product owner if the team
> member can make the set meeting time. Meeting times with faculty
> should not be adjusted to meet Dev team member's schedules. If a
> stakeholder solicits the Dev team for a meeting outside of the weekly
> standup, Jacque and the product owner needs to be in attendance.
>
> Roles

# Product Developer

> The Product Developer spends their five hours a week meeting with
> faculty members (stakeholders) and the Scrum Facilitator. During these
> meeting she/he/they gather enough information about the objectives on
> the syllabus to create features ready for the sprint.
>
> She/he/they develop a product backlog (features/objectives and due
> dates) with the stakeholders, update the backlog throughout the
> semester during meetings for future sprints, and report on progress.
> The product developer with the help of the Scrum Facilitator
> prioritizes the objectives on the (product backlog).
>
> It is the product developer's job to gather enough information from
> the faculty member to create a feature that is ready for the sprint.
> With the help of the Scrum Facilitator, the Product owner will
> prioritize the projects based on:

-   Is their enough information to make a feature.

-   What is the objective deadline.

-   How much time will take to complete a task

> The product developer also leads retrospectives and trainings.
>
> Weekly Stand-up and Planning Meeting: During the planning meeting, the
> Product Developer leads the meeting and speaks for faculty and makes
> sure that the Spring backlog is prioritized according to all of the
> faculty members' needs.

# SCRUM Advisor

> The SCRUM advisor is a servant-leader who makes sure the SCRUM process
> is running smoothly and protects the team.

-   All team members reports to Dr. Howard.

-   Dr. Howard helps to facilitate meetings, conducts one-on-ones as
    > needed with Dev. Team, and provides guidance on completing tasks.

-   Manages the team.

-   She answers any questions you may have.

# Developer (Dev Team)

> The Dev Team spends their five hours a week completing the Sprint
> backlog tasks that they claim. All of the tasks should be completed by
> the end of the sprint or detailed notes needs to be added to the card
> about the status of the task. During the planning meeting the Dev team
> negotiates the Spring backlog and breaks up the tasks into manageable
> tasks. Team members play multiple roles and will work on multiple
> projects. They work to complete the products.
>
> It is the dev's responsibility to gather all information that they
> might need before they leave the meeting. If they find themselves
> stuck when sitting down to do the task, the dev should refer to their
> notes and contact the product developer. Remember the product
> developer will not be immediately available so it is important to have
> a variety of work to do.
>
> The Dev team is responsible for updating their tasks in Trello and
> adding detailed notes. They need to supply enough information, that
> the product developer can communicate to the advisors what you did,
> how you did it, and can physically show them. It is okay for the
> product owner to come to Dev team members to ask "in the weeds"
> questions... sometimes but the Dev team is responsible for
> communicating.
>
> Tools
>
> **Sprint** -- a period of time in which goals are broken up into tasks
> to be completed. Sprints run over a course of two weeks.

# Syllabus (also known as project plans)

> Communicates with everyone the goals and expectations of the project.
> Training time is included as objectives. Faculty creates/Scrum
> Facilitator Consults. All project plans/syllabi live in the share
> drive.

# Product BackLog in Trello

> Illustrates that as the stakeholder/user, I want \[action\] so that
> \[purpose\]. Shows Objective and date, expected sprint. Product
> Developer creates/Scrum Facilitator Consults

# Sprint Backlog - Weekly Tasks in Trello

> Each week, the Product Developer creates task from the Product Backlog
> based on what needs to be accomplished during that sprint. They break
> these tasks into actionable steps with the help of the Scrum
> Facilitator and Dev Team using a User Story template.
>
> Template: As a \<type of user\>, I want \<some goal\> so that \<some
> reason\>. To do this, I must
>
> \<split the user story in to a smaller user story\> and make sure it
> \<add conditions of satisfaction\> Example: As a user, I can indicate
> folders not to backup so that my backup drive isn\'t filled up with
> things I don\'t need saved.
>
> The Scrum Backlog shows in columns the user stories columns for each
> Sprint. It shows which stories are In progress, Completed, Parking
> Lot. It also shows who is assigned to each task.

# First Meeting Agenda

> What do you want out of this internship? What is Scrum and an Agile
> framework.
>
> Lindsay Hardy, [Why Scrum]{.underline},
> [https://tulane.box.com/s/r4cknz2bc076fbio2h6rak4znny6cx8z]{.underline}
> Create working agreements:

-   Tips and what worked last year.

-   What are our team values?

-   What kinds of rules do we follow for these types of meetings.

-   How can we make the parking lot more efficient.

-   When you cannot meet the weekly goals, what do we need to see?

-   What do you want to be held accountable for as a team?

-   Last year, we focused on collaboration. What do we want to work on
    this year?

> Goals from last year:

-   Our values include: open communication, trust, honesty, clarity on
    > the things one knows and does not know, responsiveness
    > (specifically, responses to people in the group chats once on the
    > clock)

-   For our meeting we want to see: less of Jacque talking and leading
    > the meetings, no interrupting of those speaking, everyone
    > contributing in work and discussion, an environment where people
    > are comfortable to move the conversation back to a topic if they
    > have more to share

-   The parking lot can be handled through: a color flag system,
    > bringing up blockers earlier in the week not saving them until the
    > meeting

> Goals from this year:

-   Strong communication, updating the Slack

-   Don't think of yourself as branching off from the team -- don't be
    > afraid to reach out to people

-   Making sure to work earlier and keep with your schedule

-   Prioritize your tasks accordingly

-   If you didn't get all your tasks done make sure that you document
    > what you didn't get done, reflect and be honest with the team

-   Front end development

> Expectations:

-   Show up and be on-time,

-   Be forthcoming about questions,

-   Meet deadlines,

-   Hold each other accountable,

-   Report when stuck -- don\'t be afraid to reach out

-   Work on work when at work,

-   Keep the lab clean.

-   Use the clipboard and clock in.

-   Focus on teamwork. Buddy system -- teach new devs the ropes. Share
    > responsibilities. Cross functionality
