Welcome to Newcomb Institute's Technology Lab Github Page! The Technology Lab educates undergraduates about the importance of diversity and inclusion in STEM. 
It is a curated digital space that communicates Newcomb Instituteâ€™s role in working towards gender equity in STEM through undergraduate programming. 
Our Github showcases different STEM projects of Newcomb Institute undergraduates. It also provides educational resources for undergraduates to help bridge 
the gender gap in STEM. This project, specifically, promotes feminist leadership in technology-centered communities through student programming and digital 
scholarship. To learn more about the lab's values and outcomes, read [Outcomes](https://github.com/newcombtech/Tech-Lab/blob/main/Technology%20Lab/Outcomes_and_values.md).

The Technology Lab has many different facets. One of things that we help assist with is how to use the technology on the 3rd floor of the Commons. To access this guide, read the [Commons Technology Guide.](https://github.com/newcombtech/Tech-Lab/blob/main/Commons%20Technology/Commons-Technology.md)

The Technology Lab also goes to many different kinds of events such as Grace Hopper. To assist with this process and to learn more about Grace Hopper, read [Grace Hopper Celebration.](https://github.com/newcombtech/Tech-Lab/blob/main/Grace%20Hopper%20Celebration/GraceHopperConferenceSteps.md)
In addition to Grace Hopper, the Tech Lab helps undergraduates prepare for the job search. One of the ways we have done this is through a [Guide to create an effective LinkedIn.](https://github.com/newcombtech/Tech-Lab/blob/main/Grace%20Hopper%20Celebration/LinkedIn-Tips)

One of the main methodologies that we use within the Tech Lab is the Agile Scrum workflow. We have a [manual](https://github.com/newcombtech/Tech-Lab/blob/main/Technology%20Lab/SCRUM%20Manual.pdf) that helps explain its tenets, uses, benefits, for creating a collaborative work environment.
If you're still curious about why we use Scrum, look no further and read [Why Scrum?](https://github.com/newcombtech/Tech-Lab/blob/main/Technology%20Lab/Why%20Scrum.pdf).
