# NCI SHARE DRIVE -- BOX 

The **NCI Share DrivevFolder** is a box account that has been
shared with each NCI staff member. This means that this folder now shows
up in your personal TU box account. All of NCI staff has editing rights
to this folder. This means from your **own** box account you
can access, upload, delete, move files in this folder. Just like the
older share drive on the TU server, anything you put in this **NCI Share
Drive** folder can be seen by everyone in the department. <br><br>

For version control purposes, instead of attaching policy files to
list-serve emails, please upload (or drag) it to the NCI Share Drive
Folder in your Box account and share that link with everyone. Please
archive any outdated documents that you are replacing. <br><br>

1.  Login to your **own** box account.

2.  Click on the **NCI Share Drive** Folder.

3.  Create or select the folder in which you want to store your file.

        an archive folder to store that file.

This cloud based share drive will replace the current share drive
located on the server (the one that is not Nadine). We are moving away
from using the server share drive (and Nadine) because TU IT is planning
to move away from supporting these types of server-based share drives
AND more importantly because the cloud is more accessible. I am happy to
answer any questions or concerns about this on Monday or walk anyone
through how to use Box.  <br><br>
