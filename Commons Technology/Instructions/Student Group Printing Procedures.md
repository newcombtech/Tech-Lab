**Student Group Printing Procedures**

Newcomb Institute provides printing for Newcomb affiliated students
group activities.

**Procedures**:

To print, the student group must:

-   Email the attachment and printing instructions to
    ncitech@wave.tulane.edu

    -   Instructions should include number of copies requested.

    -   Include "Printing Request" in the subject line.

-   Go to the front desk of Newcomb Institute between noon to 10 pm
    Monday through Thursday and noon to 8:00 pm on Fridays. Outside of
    these times, you must work with your Newcomb advisor.

-   Notify the front desk student worker that you need to print for a
    student group.

-   The Newcomb Institute front desk student worker will print the
    documents from the NI email and retrieve them from the copier.

-   The front desk worker will document your student group, what is
    being printed, and number of copies.

-   Student groups can only print:

    -   50 pages a day of black and white handouts a day, or;\*

    -   25 pages of color handouts a day.\*

    -   Documents related to student group activities.

\*This includes reprints due to mistakes. If printing a large number of
documents, students are encouraged to print a test copy first on your
own. If the attachment includes multiple pages, the document will be
printed on two sides of the paper (front and back). Two-sided prints
will only count as one page.
